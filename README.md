I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Cybersecurity and Computer Science, with two years of focused coursework in both fields. I am passionate about learning new technologies, solving complex security challenges, and developing creative solutions that help protect systems in a landscape where the threat actors are ever-evolving.


## Objective

As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Cybersecurity and Computer Science, I am passionate about advancing my career in cybersecurity. I am enthusiastic about roles that allow me to tackle complex security challenges and develop innovative solutions. Whether in a Security Analyst position, where I can engage in incident response and analytical problem-solving, or as a Security Engineer, where I can design and implement robust security architectures.
